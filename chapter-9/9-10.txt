A reference pattern that results in severe external fragmentation in an allocator based on simple segregated storage is one
that makes a large amounts of mallocs and corresponding frees to a single storage class and then never uses that storage
class again. This leads to fragmentation because all the blocks in the pages pulled in by the OS are fixed to the size of the storage
class but will never be used by the program if the size block is not used again.
