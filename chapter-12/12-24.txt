Rio is implicitly reenterant. If the caller passes in different rio pointers in each thread,
it will correctly execute the function. However, if the same rio pointer is passed to multiple
threads calling Rio functions, it will overwrite data in the now shared rio struct. The Rio functions
require no synchonization within their methods which make the reentrant in the perspective of the
callee.
