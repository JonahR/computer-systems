The child is still able to communicate with the client because it copies its parent's file descriptor table.
Before the parent closes the connection, it's descriptor table has an entry pointing to the connection's file
table entry. The child's descriptor table is also pointing to the came descriptor table entry. When the parent
closes the connection. The link from its file table to descriptor entry is removed, but still exists for the
child. The kernel does not delete the connection's file descriptor until the reference count is zero.
