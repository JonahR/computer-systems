We need to reinitialize the `pool.ready_set` variable, because the Select function will unset
any descriptors that are not ready to be read. Beacuase of this, we lose all descriptors from
the read set, that are not ready to be read. If we would like to Select again. We want to select
on the entirity of the read set, not just what was ready for reading in the previous loop. The
Select function takes in the read set, but it returns the ready set. We must always pass in the
complete read set.
