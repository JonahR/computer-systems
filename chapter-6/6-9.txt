point is layed out in memory as:

p[[vel, vel, vel][acc, acc, acc]]

Rank order: B, C, D

B has good temporal locality because for each inner loop it reference the same value of p[i].
B has good spacial locality because it iterates over each value of vel and then each value
of acc. From above, we see that these are in order.


C has good temporal locality because for each inner loop it reference the same value of p[i].
C does not have good spacial locality because each iteration switches between storing in vel
and acc. As we see from above, these are not continuous, but stride-3.

D does not have good locality because for each inner loop, we are referencing different values
of p[i].
D does not have good spacial equality because we are referencing different values of p[i] which
have stride-6 locality.
