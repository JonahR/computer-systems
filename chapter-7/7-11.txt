The data segment occupies 0x104 bytes in memory, but only 0xe8 bytes come from
the executable file. This is because of .bss data. .bss stands for Block
started by symbol and all of its values are initialized to 0 to save space.
The executable object file is smaller, because the .bss section does not have
to initialize each value to the size it will be during runtime.
