A. Every C program needs a main fuction because the startup code in the ELF executable object file has a call to the main function.
Since C code is compiled into ELF files, if there is no main function, the call to main would fail when the ELF file is loaded
into memory.


Yes, I have wondered why a C program can end with exit, a return value, or nothing and still terminate properly. This is because
after the main function ends, control will be sent back to the startup code in the ELF executable file. The next line in the ELF
is a call to the operating systems _exit function which sends control back to the operation system.
