In p2(), main returns 0x55 because there is a strong symbol reference to main
in foo6.c. In bar6.c, char main is linked to the int main() function. When
printing the hexademinal value of the int main() function as a char, we get
0x55. I do not know why it is 0x55, but this is most likely the lower order
bytes of the function location on a little endian machine.
